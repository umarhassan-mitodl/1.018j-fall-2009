There may be extra credit questions on the exams as well as extra credit activities. These count above and beyond the normal curve of the class (in other words, you can get an A without extra credit). Extra credit factors into a grade only when a student is on the borderline between two grades. It can tip the balance.

Expectations
------------

Show up, be honest, and do your best.

We hope that as a result of this course you will:

*   Look at the Earth in a different way, and appreciate the complex interactions between living organisms and the non-living components of our planet. It is these interactions that shape your future.
*   Become a more critical thinker, and bring the concepts you learned in this course into the way you approach your life and careers.
*   Improve your writing and speaking skills.

Academic Honesty
----------------

Although MIT does not have an honor code, in 1.018 we function as though it does. We will not police you. We assume that you are honest, are here to learn, and are proud of your work.

Policy on cheating
------------------

If a student is caught turning in a paper or homework that was written by someone else, or copying text from sources without referencing them, or cheating on an exam, he or she will be given an F on the assignment, and likely be reported to the Committee on Discipline. If you have questions regarding what constitutes the appropriate use of sources and plagiarism, you should consult with a member of the course staff. _Academic Integrity at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology_ is a useful handbook for understanding what constitutes violations of academic integrity, for citing sources, and for avoiding plagiarism.
